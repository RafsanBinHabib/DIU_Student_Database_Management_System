# 🎓 DIU Student Database Management System

A fully designed and implemented relational database system built as part of the Database Management System (DBMS) course (CIS222) – Spring 2025.

This project simulates a real-world university database system to manage students, faculty, courses, teachers, and academic projects using SQL.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The system is designed to:

- Store detailed student information
- Manage faculty supervision
- Track student projects/thesis
- Handle course registrations
- Maintain teacher-course assignments
- Execute analytical SQL queries

The database is fully normalized and enforces referential integrity using primary and foreign key constraints.
